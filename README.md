# zig-date

`zig-date` is a date and time library for the Zig, inspired by the popular Rust library [chrono](https://github.com/chronotope/chrono). It provides a comprehensive set of functions and types for working with dates, times, and durations. The library is designed to be easy to use, efficient, and accurate. It supports both monotonic and system clocks, and provides types for representing time points, durations, and calendars. `zig-date` offers a range of formatting and parsing functions, making it easy to work with human-readable date and time strings. Additionally, it provides a range of timezone manipulation functions, allowing for easy calculations of time differences and conversions between timezones. With its simple, yet powerful API, `zig-date` is the perfect choice for handling date and time operations in Zig.
